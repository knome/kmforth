we're eventually going to need somewhere to annotate functions
I think this syntax looks reasonable
we'll need to update the parser to allow multiple definitions where they have *
we'll further require they all appear in the same file, and we'll take the first definition
  whose requirements are fulfilled by our current values
  
after the ** will come optimization information, allowing functions to describe conditions they can be turned to constants, etc
attrs, rather than being requirements, are annotations used for optimization

I'll save the precise syntax for that trash for later

:main { $hello * os=linux, features=fpu,vme,xtopology ** ... }
  -1 writeno
  -1 writenosize
;
